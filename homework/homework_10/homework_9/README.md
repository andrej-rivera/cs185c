# Project Description

In this project, I will be looking how the monsoon seasons affect salinity in the tropics at certain periods of time. 
As a general topic, I will be answering the following question:


*Do monsoon seasons (in the Philippines) affect salinity levels differently during El Niño years compared to La Niña years?*

To answer this question, I will be creating a model that encompasses the Philippines region and the bodies of water that surround it, the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. My model will be observing salinity during two years with notable El Niño and La Niña intensities: 1997 (Strong El Niño year) and 1998 (Strong La Niña year). These are based on the [Oceanic Niño Index (ONI)](https://ggweather.com/enso/oni.htm). For my project, I will be primarily using data from the ECCO Version 5 model in the years provided. For both years, I will start my model at May and end my model at October (observed monthly); the range between May and October represents the Monsoon seasons in the Philippines. To analyze results, I'll create two timeseriesand look at differences in salinity throughout time for both years. I'll also be creating a movie of salinity differences comparing both years.


Before running this experiment, my initial hypothesis on the question is that La Niña years will experience lower salinity levels than El Niño years. The basis in this hypothesis lies in the characteristics of El Niño and La Niña years. For El Niño years, locations near the equator (like the Philippines) are much hotter and so rainfall would be decreased as a result. Meanwhile, the situation is reversed for La Niña years and so rainfall would increase, leading to a lower salinity level because of all the rainfall.
